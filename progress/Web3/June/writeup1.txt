This writeup was just what I have learned till the time of writing. It is my realization 
about blockchain. It could be updated in the future.

What is clockchain?
    Blockchain is 
        a chain of blocks that works as a decentralized system with the features of:
            without central control 
            consensus
            stability
            immutability
            trustless
      
    Blockchain is like linked list. 
        Linked list stores data while blockchain stores information or transactions.
    Blockchain is like machine learning. 
        They both automate some tasks and provide conveniences.
        Machine learning automates the tasks after learning from prior experiences.
        Blockchain automates the tasks by decentralizing the architecture and eliminating 
           the central controlling authority.

Pros:
    convenience because of no intermediary, or bank.
    less cost of service fee
    transparancy
    traceability of data

Cons:
    computation power consumption
    high cost of implementation and integration 
    can not go back

Opportunities:
    finance
    insurance companies
    education
    healthcare
    sypply chain

Challenges:
    scalability
    sometimes inefficient
    risks(security, privacy leaking)
